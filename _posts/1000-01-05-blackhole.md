Check out the shader on <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/7tBfW1" target="_blank">ShaderToy</a> where you can interact with it in browser in real time.

Developed as a personal project in May 2022 I wanted to simulate the effects of general relativity around a black hole using ray marching. While not completely physically acurrate, it does bend the rays as they appraoch the black hole and many realistic phenomenon can be seen, such as the photon ring that surrounds the event horizon.
