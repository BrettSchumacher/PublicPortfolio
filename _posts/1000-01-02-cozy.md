Made for the UMN Video Game Development Club during Fall 2021. Check it out on <a href="https://theshoes.itch.io/cozy-little-cosmos" target="_blank">ItchIO</a>.

The game is a small exploration game where you play as a drone flying around 3 abandoned planets/moons trying to piece together what transpired.

As a part of a small team, I handled the programming which included:
<ul>
    <li>Intuitive controls for planetary navigation</li>
    <li>AI for rogue drone swarms</li>
    <li>Level save systems so changes stay when the player goes between worlds</li>
    <li>Shader code for toon-shaded effect</li>
</ul>
