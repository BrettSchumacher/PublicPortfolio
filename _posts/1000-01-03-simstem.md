Submission to GMTK 2021 Game Jam, check out the game page <a href="https://theshoes.itch.io/sim-stem" target="_blank">here</a>.

All programming and UI were done by me, with level design assistance from a couple friends. The game is a short puzzle game where you need to place planets and set their initial velocities so that gravity moves them to reach certain checkpoints and goals.
