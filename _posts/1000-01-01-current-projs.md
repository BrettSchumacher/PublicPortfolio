Here's a quick overview of some of the projects I'm working on right now:
<ul>
    <li>A VR Museum exhibit creation tool for Unity3D. I'm collaborating with a medial artifacts library at the University of Minnesota to create a general tool for developing VR exhibits. This will go towrads my Honor's Thesis where I will create an exhibit with this tool and run a study to get user feedback.</li>
    <li>A 2-player FPS in the styles of Titanfall 2 and Ultrakill. I am the Enemy Systems and AI programmer in a larger group. This involves creating a general AI framework that I build on for each enemy, as well as systems for tracking their stats and handling wave spawning logic.</li>
    <li>Redirected walking research as a part of Professor Evan Suma Rosenberg's VR lab. We are hoping to run a study and submit a paper for next year's IEEEVR Conference.</li>
</ul>
